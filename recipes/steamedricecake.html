    <h2>Description</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups rice flour</li>
        <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons tapioca starch</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk rice flour, water, coconut milk, sugar, tapioca starch, yeast, vanilla extract, 
            and salt together in a bowl until smooth. 
            Cover with a lid. Let batter rest until air bubbles rise to the surface, about 2 hours. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Grease cake molds with oil. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Place cake molds on top and pour batter into each, leaving 1 3/4 inches of space at the top for rising. 
            Bring water to a boil. Cover and steam until a toothpick inserted into a cake comes out clean, about 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
